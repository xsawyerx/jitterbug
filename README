NAME
    jitterbug - Contiuous integration for Perl modules on Github.com

DESCRIPTION
    Jitterbug accepts hooks that describe what to monitor. If you don't use
    Github, you'll need to write a script that will send a JSON request to
    Jitterbug to add your repository. There is a template available at
    "t/data/".

    There are plans to write a commit hook that will do the job as well.

SETUP
  Configuring Github
    In the *admin* section in your repo (
    <https://github.com/franckcuny/net-http-spore/edit>), pick the *service
    hook* menu on the left, choose post receive url and put the url of your
    Jitterbug setup (like <http://myjitterbug.org/hook/>).

    You can protect the </hook/> path with an htaccess (and use
    <http://user:pass@myjitterbug.org/hook/>) or you can use
    Plack::Middleware::Auth::Basic with an "enable_if" on the path to match
    */hook/*.

    You can find more information on post-receive-hooks
    <http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/|here>.

  Running the builder
    Once Jitterbug is running (the web service part), you need to execute
    the script found in *scripts/builder.pl* that will monitor any incoming
    commits in the database and run the build for them.

  Testing without Github
    You can try your setup with the *eg/post_hook.t* file. Edit this file to
    point the url to your local Jitterbug and it will insert a valid commit
    for Dancer so you can try it locally without doing anything on Github
    yet.
